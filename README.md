Neural Network-Based Models
A collection of neural network implementations and experiments using Python and machine learning libraries, designed to understand and demonstrate core concepts of deep learning, including feedforward networks, activation functions, backpropagation, and training using real-world datasets.

🔍 Overview
This project contains multiple Python-based implementations of neural networks for tasks like classification and prediction. The aim is to gain practical insights into how neural networks learn from data and how various parameters affect performance.
