# 🧠 Neural Network-Based Models

A collection of neural network implementations and experiments using Python and machine learning libraries. This project is designed to help understand and demonstrate core concepts of deep learning, including feedforward networks, activation functions, backpropagation, and training on real-world datasets.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository includes multiple Python-based neural network implementations for tasks such as classification and prediction. The goal is to gain hands-on insights into how neural networks learn from data and how different architectural or training parameters influence performance.
